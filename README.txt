ListenerApp_fixed.zip
=====================

This archive contains corrected root files for your ListenerApp repo so GitHub Actions can build the APK.

Files included (place these into the repo root, replacing existing files):
- settings.gradle
- build.gradle
- .github/workflows/build-apk.yml

How to use:
1) Download this zip and extract its contents.
2) In GitHub, go to your repo (branch 'main'), then:
   - Edit the existing files (settings.gradle and build.gradle) and replace with the contents from these files.
   - Create the folder `.github/workflows/` if it doesn't exist, then create `build-apk.yml` with the workflow contents.
3) Commit all changes to the **main** branch and trigger Actions (push or re-run latest workflow).
4) If build fails, copy the first 20 lines of the failing step's log and paste them back here.

If you'd rather I paste the file contents directly into the chat so you can create them in GitHub web editor, tell me "paste files" and I'll output them inline.
